Implemented subsecvente first with a naive brute-force algorithm, that takes every string sequentialy and finds the biggest sub-string. With luck I got 70 points.

Then I concentrated on biperm. Found the solution for the first part as 2 to the power of the number of cycles. Implemented disjoint sets for this number. Then I tried naive to permute elements until the permutation was valid. The LIMIT constant is a hack to stop the program before it executes too many steps, so I could stop the program before the alloted time and print only the first value for 30 points. The solution got 44 points.

As usual, the local olympiad is a Russian roullete, and I had a lucky day.
